**Built With:**

* **Kotlin:** The official and preferred programming language for modern Android development, known for its conciseness, safety, and interoperability with Java.
* **Coroutines:** Designed to streamline asynchronous programming, enhancing the app's responsiveness and enabling non-blocking operations seamlessly.
* **Flow:** A powerful mechanism for handling asynchronous data streams, providing a reactive programming approach for efficient data handling.
* **Android Architecture Components:** This collection of libraries by Google aids in building robust, maintainable, and testable applications. Key components utilized likely include:
    * **ViewModel:** Persists UI-related data that survives configuration changes, ensuring a consistent experience.
    * **ViewBinding:** Simplifies interactions with view elements by auto-generating binding classes, reducing boilerplate code and improving development efficiency.
* **Video Loading Libraries (Optional):**
    * **Coil:** A Kotlin-based image loading library that leverages coroutines for asynchronous operations, potentially used in the app.
    * **Media3:** Another popular video loading library known for its performance and flexibility .


The Gallery App should automatically detect these new videos and display them within its interface.
